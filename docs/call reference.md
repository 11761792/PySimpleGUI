text-align: center; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;"><b>Please don't scroll away!</b><br> Hi... it's Mike, the guy that invented, wrote the code for the ports, the documentation, maintains and expands the code, and recorded the YouTube videos and other materials you see. 
Your help, valued user, is needed to keep the project open.  <b>The financial situation is dire and on the current course, the project will close in March 2022.</b> When I released PySimpleGUI in 2018, I decided to work full-time on the project. The &lt; $100 that is typically received monthly doesn't cover the ongoing project costs, and pays none of my basic costs of living.  It's clearly not sustainable and the end is in sight unless something changes dramatically. Our support engineer has been so generous in donating his time. Everyone else that's worked on the project has been paid. The Udemy course I’ve been developing the past 12 months is nearly complete and will help provide some income. A HUGE “Thank You” to everyone that’s supported the project through financial donations and the wonderful messages sent showing your appreciation. I would like the project to live on and need your help to make that happen.  <b>Please consider sponsoring or donating so that PySimpleGUI doesn't end.  Thank you to everyone that's made this journey so enjoyable.</b></p><div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 5px; justify-content: center; gap: 20px"> <button style="display:

# ELEMENT AND FUNCTION CALL REFERENCE

Here you will find the details for all Elements, Objects, and Functions that are available to you.  If you want to use a complex element and don't understand the parameters, then this is the right place to come.  For every element you're shown the parameters used to create it as well as all methods available to call.

## This call reference document covers the tkinter port

This documentation is created using the PySimpleGUI.py file which means it's based on the tkinter code. Some of the calls are different, might not exist at all, or there may be more methods/functions for the other PySimpleGUI ports (Qt, Wx, Web).  

The PySimpleGUIQt call reference is located in another location.

## Caution - Some functions / methods may be internal only yet exposed in this documentation

This section of the documentation is generated directly from the source code.  As a result, sometimes internal only functions or methods that you are not supposed to be calling are accidentally shown in this documentation.  Hopefully these accidents don't happen often.

# The Elements

## Graph Element 

    Creates an area for you to draw on.  The MAGICAL property this Element has is that you interact
    with the element using your own coordinate system.  This is an important point!!  YOU define where the location
    is for (0,0).  Want (0,0) to be in the middle of the graph like a math 4-quadrant graph?  No problem!  Set your
    lower left corner to be (-100,-100) and your upper right to be (100,100) and you've got yourself a graph with
    (0,0) at the center.
    One of THE coolest of the Elements.
    You can also use float values. To do so, be sure and set the float_values parameter.
    Mouse click and drag events are possible and return the (x,y) coordinates of the mouse
    Drawing primitives return an "id" that is referenced when you want to operation on that item (e.g. to erase it)

```
Graph(canvas_size,
    graph_bottom_left,
    graph_top_right,
    background_color = None,

## Menu Element 

    Menu Element is the Element that provides a Menu Bar that goes across the top of the window, just below titlebar.
    Here is an example layout.  The "&" are shortcut keys ALT+key.
    Is a List of -  "Item String" + List
    Where Item String is what will be displayed on the Menubar itself.
    The List that follows the item represents the items that are shown then Menu item is clicked
    Notice how an "entry" in a mennu can be a list which means it branches out and shows another menu, etc. (resursive)
    menu_def = [['&File', ['!&Open', '&Save::savekey', '---', '&Properties', 'E&xit']],
                ['!&Edit', ['!&Paste', ['Special', 'Normal', ], 'Undo'], ],
                ['&Debugger', ['Popout', 'Launch Debugger']],
                ['&Toolbar', ['Command &1', 'Command &2', 'Command &3', 'Command &4']],
                ['&Help', '&About...'], ]
    Finally, "keys" can be added to entries so make them unique.  The "Save" entry has a key associated with it. You
    can see it has a "::" which signifies the beginning of a key.  The user will not see the key portion when the
    menu is shown.  The key portion is returned as part of the event.

### Update

Update a menubar - can change the menu definition and visibility.  The entire menu has to be specified

```
Update(menu_definition = None, visible = None)
```

## MenubarCustom Element

Note that while the MenubarCustom is an element, it is implemented using a function.
It is actually a "compound element" that consists of several elements combined into a single Column element.
See the Column element to get a list of method calls available.  The function returns a Column element.

A custom Menubar that replaces the OS provided Menubar

Why?
Two reasons - 1. they look great (see custom titlebar) 2. if you have a custom titlebar, then you have to use a custom menubar if you want a menubar

```
MenubarCustom(menu_definition,
    disabled_text_color = None,
    bar_font = None,
    font = None,
    tearoff = False,
    pad = None,
    p = None,

    text_color = None,
    bar_background_color = None,

        This will allow you to make a Multline element drag a window for example

```python
grab_anywhere_include()
```

### hide_row

Hide the entire row an Element is located on.
        Use this if you must have all space removed when you are hiding an element, including the row container

```python
hide_row()
```

### print

Print like Python normally prints except route the output to a multiline element and also add colors if desired

colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter

There are also "aliases" for text_color, background_color and colors (t, b, c)
t - An alias for color of the text (makes for shorter calls)
b - An alias for the background_color parameter
c - (str, str) - "shorthand" way of specifying color. (foreground, backgrouned)
c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")

With the aliases it's possible to write the same print but in more compact ways:
cprint('This will print white text on red background', c=('white', 'red'))
cprint('This will print white text on red background', c='white on red')
cprint('This will print white text on red background', text_color='white', background_color='red')
cprint('This will print white text on red background', t='white', b='red')

```

    end = None,
    sep = None,
    text_color = None,
    background_color = None,
    justification = None,

## OptionMenu Element 

    Option Menu is an Element available ONLY on the tkinter port of PySimpleGUI.  It's is a widget that is unique
    to tkinter.  However, it looks much like a ComboBox.  Instead of an arrow to click to pull down the list of
    choices, another little graphic is shown on the widget to indicate where you click.  After clicking to activate,
    it looks like a Combo Box that you scroll to select a choice.

```
OptionMenu(values,
    default_value = None,
    size = (None, None),
    s = (None, None),
    disabled = False,

    expand_y = False,
    background_color = None,
    text_color = None,
    key = None,

## Output Element (No longer recommended - USE `Multiline` instead)

Rather than use the `Output` element, it's recommended that you use the `Multiline` element instead.  The reason for this is that more controls have been added to the Multiline and in the future you can expect more features will be added to the Multiline while the `Output` element has stopped being enhanced.

You can control which Multiline Element receives your stdout output as well as use the color-print (`cprint`) with a Multiline.

    Output Element - a multi-lined text area where stdout and stderr are re-routed to.

    The Multiline Element is the superior and recommended method for showing the output of stdout.
    The Multiline Element has been added to significantly while the Output element has not.

    Of course, Output Element continues to operate and be backwards compatible, but you're missing out on
    features such as routing the cprint output to the element.

```
Output(size = (None, None),
    s = (None, None),
    background_color = None,
    text_color = None,
    pad = None,
    p = None,
    echo_stdout_stderr = False,

## Push Element (alias include `P` and `Stretch`)

Not a true element, but a function acting like an element.

These elements `Push` and `VPush` as aliases for `Stretch` and `VStretch` and are implemented using a function rather than a class.  They're not meant to be manipulated like other elements.  They have a functional role in a layout that is much like the "Layout Helper Functions" (pin, vtop, etc).

The name `Stretch` originally appeared in the PySimpleGUI APIs when the PySimpleGUIQt port was added.

In the Sept 2021 time-frame, a functioning version of this element appeared in the tkinter port, along with some aliases and a vertical addition.

The PySimpleGUI documentation, demos, etc, will be using the names `Push` and `VPush`.

### Push-style Elements Use

These elements modify the placement of other elements inside of containers.  As the name implies, these elements `Push` and `VPush` will "push" other elements around.  `Push` works in the horizontal direction, `VPush` in the vertical.

A `Push` element will "push" elements on the row away from it.  If you have 1 `Push` as the start of a row, then the row will be right-justified.  If you have two `Push` elements, one as the first element and one as the last element on a row, then the row will be centered.

Acts like a Stretch element found in the Qt port.
Used in a Horizontal fashion.  Placing one on each side of an element will enter the element.
Place one to the left and the element to the right will be right justified.  See VStretch for vertical type

```
Push(background_color = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | background_color | color of background may be needed because of how this is implemented |

```
set_size(size = (None, None))
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (int, int) | size | The size in characters, rows typically. In some cases they are pixels |

        Note that it will re-appear at the bottom of the window / container, most likely.

```python
unhide_row()
```

### update

Changes some of the settings for the Spin Element. Must call `Window.Read` or `Window.Finalize` prior
Note that the state can be in 3 states only.... enabled, disabled, readonly even
though more combinations are available. The easy way to remember is that if you
change the readonly parameter then you are enabling the element.

```

## Titlebar Element

Note that while the Titlebar is an element, it is implemented using a function.

It is actually a "compound element" that consists of several elements combined into a single Column element.
See the Column element to get a list of method calls available.  The function returns a Column element.  This type of construct is referred to as "User Defined Elements" in the documentation and tutorials.

A custom titlebar that replaces the OS provided titlebar, thus giving you control
the is not possible using the OS provided titlebar such as the color.

NOTE LINUX USERS - at the moment the minimize function is not yet working.  Windows users
should have no problem and it should function as a normal window would.

This titlebar is created from a row of elements that is then encapulated into a
single Column element which is what the Titlebar returns to you.

A custom titlebar removes the margins from your window.  Ify ou want the  remainder
of your Window to have margins, place the layout after the Titlebar into a Column and
set the pad of that Column to the dimensions you would like your margins to have.

The Titlebar is a COLUMN element.  You can thus call the update method for the column and
perform operations such as making the column visible/invisible

```
Titlebar(title = "",
    icon = None,
    text_color = None,
    background_color = None,
    font = None,
    key = None,
    k = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|        str or bytes or None        |       icon       | Can be either a filename or Base64 byte string of a PNG. For Windows if filename, it MUST be ICO format. For Linux, must NOT be ICO |
|                str                 |      title       | The "title" to show in the titlebar |
|            str or None             |    text_color    | Text color for titlebar |
|            str or None             | background_color | Background color for titlebar |
| (str or (str, int[, str]) or None) |       font       | Font to be used for the text and the symbols |
| str or int or tuple or object or None |       key        | Identifies an Element. Should be UNIQUE to this window. |
| str or int or tuple or object or None |        k         | Exactly the same as key. Choose one of them to use |
| Column | **RETURN** | A single Column element that has eveything in 1 element

## TreeData (for Tree Element) 

    Class that user fills in to represent their tree data. It's a very simple tree representation with a root "Node"
    with possibly one or more children "Nodes".  Each Node contains a key, text to display, list of values to display
    and an icon.  The entire tree is built using a single method, Insert.  Nothing else is required to make the tree.

Instantiate the object, initializes the Tree Data, creates a root node for you

```python
TreeData()
```

### Node

Contains information about the individual node in the tree

```
Node(parent,
    key,
    text,
    values,
    icon = None)
```

### insert

Inserts a node into the tree. This is how user builds their tree, by Inserting Nodes
This is the ONLY user callable method in the TreeData class

```
insert(parent,
    key,
    text,
    values,
    icon = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|            Node            | parent | the parent Node |
| str or int or tuple or object |  key   | Used to uniquely identify this node |
|            str             |  text  | The text that is displayed at this node's location |
|         List[Any]          | values | The list of values that are displayed at this node |

## VerticalSeparator Element 

    Vertical Separator Element draws a vertical line at the given location. It will span 1 "row". Usually paired with
    Column Element if extra height is needed

```
VerticalSeparator(color = None,
    pad = None,
    p = None,

### bind

Used to add tkinter events to an Element.
The tkinter specific data is in the Element's member variable user_bind_event

```
bind(bind_string, key_modifier)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | bind_string  | The string tkinter expected in its bind function |
| str | key_modifier | Additional data to be added to the element's key when event is returned |

### expand

Causes the Element to expand to fill available space in the X and Y directions.  Can specify which or both directions

```
expand(expand_x = False,
    expand_y = False,
    expand_row = True)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| bool |  expand_x  | If True Element will expand in the Horizontal directions |
| bool |  expand_y  | If True Element will expand in the Vertical directions |
| bool | expand_row | If True the row containing the element will also expand. Without this your element is "trapped" within the row |

### get_size

Return the size of an element in Pixels.  Care must be taken as some elements use characters to specify their size but will return pixels when calling this get_size method.

`get_size()`

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|(int, int)| **return** | width and height of the element |

### grab_anywhere_exclude

Excludes this element from being used by the grab_anywhere feature
        Handy for elements like a Graph element when dragging is enabled. You want the Graph element to get the drag events instead of the window dragging.

```python
grab_anywhere_exclude()
```

### grab_anywhere_include

Includes this element in the grab_anywhere feature
        This will allow you to make a Multline element drag a window for example

```python
grab_anywhere_include()
```

### hide_row

Hide the entire row an Element is located on.
        Use this if you must have all space removed when you are hiding an element, including the row container

```python
hide_row()
```

### metadata

#### property: metadata

Metadata is an Element property that you can use at any time to hold any value

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|(Any)| **return** | the current metadata value |

### set_cursor

Sets the cursor for the current Element.
"Cursor" is used in 2 different ways in this call.
For the parameter "cursor" it's actually the mouse pointer.
If you do not want any mouse pointer, then use the string "none"
For the parameter "cursor_color" it's the color of the beam used when typing into an input element

```
set_cursor(cursor = None, cursor_color = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|

| str |    cursor    | The tkinter cursor name |
| str | cursor_color | color to set the "cursor" to |

### set_focus

Sets the current focus to be on this element

```
set_focus(force = False)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| bool | force | if True will call focus_force otherwise calls focus_set |

### set_size

Changes the size of an element to a specific size.
It's possible to specify None for one of sizes so that only 1 of the element's dimensions are changed.

```
set_size(size = (None, None))
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (int, int) | size | The size in characters, rows typically. In some cases they are pixels |

### set_tooltip

### unhide_row

Unhides (makes visible again) the row container that the Element is located on.
        Note that it will re-appear at the bottom of the window / container, most likely.

```python
unhide_row()
```

### visible

#### property: visible

Returns visibility state for the element.  This is a READONLY property

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|(bool)| **return** | Visibility state for element |

------------------------------

## VPush Element (aliases include `VP` and `VStretch`)

Like the `Push` element, this is not a true element but rather a function acting like an element.  It will "Push" all elements above and below away from it.

Example:  If first row has a `VPush`, then your layout will be At the bottom of the container it is in.  If one is on the last row, then the layout will be at the top of the container.  If you use TWO `VPush`, one on the first row and one on the last row, then your layout will be centered vertically.

Acts like a Stretch element found in the Qt port.
Used in a Vertical fashion.

```
VPush(background_color = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | background_color | color of background may be needed because of how this is implemented |

### add_row

Adds a single row of elements to a window's self.Rows variables.
Generally speaking this is NOT how users should be building Window layouts.
Users, create a single layout (a list of lists) and pass as a parameter to Window object, or call Window.Layout(layout)

```
add_row(args=*<1 or N object>)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|  | *args | List[Elements] |

### add_rows

Loops through a list of lists of elements and adds each row, list, to the layout.
This is NOT the best way to go about creating a window.  Sending the entire layout at one time and passing
it as a parameter to the Window call is better.

```
add_rows(rows)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| List[List[Elements]] | rows | A list of a list of elements |

### alpha_channel

#### property: alpha_channel

A property that changes the current alpha channel value (internal value)

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|(float)| **return** | the current alpha channel setting according to self, not read directly from tkinter |

### bind

Used to add tkinter events to a Window.
The tkinter specific data is in the Window's member variable user_bind_event

```
bind(bind_string, key)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|            str             | bind_string | The string tkinter expected in its bind function |
| str or int or tuple or object |     key     | The event that will be generated when the tkinter event occurs |

### bring_to_front

Brings this window to the top of all other windows (perhaps may not be brought before a window made to "stay
        on top")

```python
bring_to_front()
```

### close

Closes window.  Users can safely call even if window has been destroyed.   Should always call when done with
        a window so that resources are properly freed up within your thread.

```python
close()
```

### current_location

Get the current location of the window's top left corner.
Sometimes, depending on the environment, the value returned does not include the titlebar,etc
A new option, more_accurate, can be used to get the theoretical upper leftmost corner of the window.
The titlebar and menubar are crated by the OS. It gets really confusing when running in a webpage (repl, trinket)
Thus, the values can appear top be "off" due to the sometimes unpredictable way the location is calculated.

```
current_location(more_accurate = False)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

### disappear

Causes a window to "disappear" from the screen, but remain on the taskbar. It does this by turning the alpha
        channel to 0.  NOTE that on some platforms alpha is not supported. The window will remain showing on these
        platforms.  The Raspberry Pi for example does not have an alpha setting

```python
disappear()
```

### elem

### element

### element_list

Returns a list of all elements in the window

`element_list()`

However, if you wish to perform a lookup without error checking, and don't have error popups turned
off globally, you'll need to make this call so that you can disable error checks on this call.

find_element is yypically used in combination with a call to element's Update method (or any other element method!):
window[key].update(new_value)

window.FindElement(key).Update(new_value)

This call can be abbreviated to any of these:
find_element = FindElement == Element == Find
With find_element being the PEP8 compliant call that should be used.

Rememeber that this call will return None if no match is found which may cause your code to crash if not
checked for.

### These are non-PEP8 Compliant Methods - do NOT use

***Do not use these***... they are here for your reference should you see them in old code.

The following methods are here for backwards compatibility reference.  You will find there are PEP8 versions for each of these methods.  The PEP8 versions will be all lower case and have underscores.

### AddRow

Adds a single row of elements to a window's self.Rows variables.
Generally speaking this is NOT how users should be building Window layouts.
Users, create a single layout (a list of lists) and pass as a parameter to Window object, or call Window.Layout(layout)

```
AddRow(args=*<1 or N object>)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|  | *args | List[Elements] |

### AddRows

Loops through a list of lists of elements and adds each row, list, to the layout.
This is NOT the best way to go about creating a window.  Sending the entire layout at one time and passing
it as a parameter to the Window call is better.

```
AddRows(rows)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| List[List[Elements]] | rows | A list of a list of elements |

### AlphaChannel

#### property: AlphaChannel

### BringToFront

Brings this window to the top of all other windows (perhaps may not be brought before a window made to "stay
        on top")

```python
BringToFront()
```

### Close

Closes window.  Users can safely call even if window has been destroyed.   Should always call when done with
        a window so that resources are properly freed up within your thread.

```python
Close()
```

### CurrentLocation

Get the current location of the window's top left corner.
Sometimes, depending on the environment, the value returned does not include the titlebar,etc
A new option, more_accurate, can be used to get the theoretical upper leftmost corner of the window.
The titlebar and menubar are crated by the OS. It gets really confusing when running in a webpage (repl, trinket)
Thus, the values can appear top be "off" due to the sometimes unpredictable way the location is calculated.

```
CurrentLocation(more_accurate = False)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| bool | more_accurate | If True, will use the window's geometry to get the topmost location with titlebar, menubar taken into account |
| Tuple[(int or None), (int or None)] | **RETURN** | The x and y location in tuple form (x,y)

### Disable

```python
Disable()
```

### DisableDebugger

```python
DisableDebugger()
```

### Disappear

Causes a window to "disappear" from the screen, but remain on the taskbar. It does this by turning the alpha
        channel to 0.  NOTE that on some platforms alpha is not supported. The window will remain showing on these
        platforms.  The Raspberry Pi for example does not have an alpha setting

```python
Disappear()
```

### Elem

Find element object associated with the provided key.
THIS METHOD IS NO LONGER NEEDED to be called by the user

You can perform the same operation by writing this statement:
element = window[key]

You can drop the entire "find_element" function name and use [ ] instead.

However, if you wish to perform a lookup without error checking, and don't have error popups turned
off globally, you'll need to make this call so that you can disable error checks on this call.

find_element is yypically used in combination with a call to element's Update method (or any other element method!):
window[key].update(new_value)

Versus the "old way"
window.FindElement(key).Update(new_value)

This call can be abbreviated to any of these:
find_element = FindElement == Element == Find
With find_element being the PEP8 compliant call that should be used.

Rememeber that this call will return None if no match is found which may cause your code to crash if not
checked for.

### FindElement

** Warning ** This call will eventually be depricated. **

It is suggested that you modify your code to use the recommended window[key] lookup or the PEP8 compliant window.find_element(key)

For now, you'll only see a message printed and the call will continue to funcation as before.

Without this call your changes to a Window will not be visible to the user until the next Read call

`Refresh()`

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|(Window)| **return** | `self` so that method calls can be easily "chained" |

### SaveToDisk

Saves the values contained in each of the input areas of the form. Basically saves what would be returned from a call to Read.  It takes these results and saves them to disk using pickle.
 Note that every element in your layout that is to be saved must have a key assigned to it.

```
SaveToDisk(filename)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | filename | Filename to save the values to in pickled form |

### SendToBack

Pushes this window to the bottom of the stack of windows. It is the opposite of BringToFront

```python
SendToBack()
```

### SetAlpha

Sets the Alpha Channel for a window.  Values are between 0 and 1 where 0 is completely transparent

```
SetAlpha(alpha)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| float | alpha | 0 to 1. 0 is completely transparent. 1 is completely visible and solid (can't see through) |

### SetIcon

Changes the icon that is shown on the title bar and on the task bar.
NOTE - The file type is IMPORTANT and depends on the OS!
Can pass in:
* filename which must be a .ICO icon file for windows, PNG file for Linux
* bytes object
* BASE64 encoded file held in a variable

```
SetIcon(icon = None, pngbase64 = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|  str  |   icon    | Filename or bytes object |
| bytes | pngbase64 | Base64 encoded image |

### SetTransparentColor

Set the color that will be transparent in your window. Areas with this color will be SEE THROUGH.

```
SetTransparentColor(color)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | color | Color string that defines the transparent color |

### Size

#### property: Size

Return the current size of the window in pixels

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Tuple[(int), (int)] or Tuple[None, None]| **return** | (width, height) of the window |

### UnHide

Used to bring back a window that was previously hidden using the Hide method

```python
UnHide()
```

### VisibilityChanged

When making an element in a column or someplace that has a scrollbar, then you'll want to call this function
        prior to the column's contents_changed() method.

```python
VisibilityChanged()
```

## Layout Helper Funcs

Pin's an element provided into a layout so that when it's made invisible and visible again, it will
 be in the correct place.  Otherwise it will be placed at the end of its containing window/column.

## Version Info

Returns a human-readable string of version numbers for:

Python version
PySimpleGUI Port (tkinter in this case)
tkinter version
PySimpleGUI version
The location of the PySimpleGUI.py file

The format is a newline between each value and descriptive text for each line

```
get_versions()
```

## Multi-window Interface

Reads all windows that are "active" when the call is made. "Active" means that it's been finalized or read.
If a window has not been finalized then it will not be considered an "active window"

If any of the active windows returns a value then the window and its event and values
are returned.

If no windows are open, then the value (None, WIN_CLOSED, None) will be returned
Since WIN_CLOSED is None, it means (None, None, None) is what's returned when no windows remain opened

```
read_all_windows(timeout = None, timeout_key = "__TIMEOUT__")
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| int |   timeout   | Time in milliseconds to delay before a returning a timeout event |
| Any | timeout_key | Key to return when a timeout happens. Defaults to the standard TIMEOUT_KEY |

This Button has been changed in how it works!!
Your button has been replaced with a normal button that has the PySimpleGUI Debugger buggon logo on it.
In your event loop, you will need to check for the event of this button and then call:
show_debugger_popout_window()

```

This is a special type of Button.

It will close the window but NOT send an event that the window has been closed.

It's used in conjunction with non-blocking windows to silently close them.  They are used to
implement the non-blocking popup windows. They're also found in some Demo Programs, so look there for proper use.

It can be a tuple or a single single. Both text and background colors need to be specified
colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter
c - (str, str) - Colors tuple has format (foreground, backgrouned)
c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")

Close a previously opened EasyPrint window

```
EasyPrintClose()
```

Works like a "print" statement but with windowing options.  Routes output to the "Debug Window"

In addition to the normal text and background colors, you can use a "colors" tuple/string
The "colors" or "c" parameter defines both the text and background in a single parm.
It can be a tuple or a single single. Both text and background colors need to be specified
colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter
c - (str, str) - Colors tuple has format (foreground, backgrouned)
c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")

## Color Printing to Multiline Element of a Window

Color print to a multiline element in a window of your choice.
Must have EITHER called cprint_set_output_destination prior to making this call so that the
window and element key can be saved and used here to route the output, OR used the window
and key parameters to the cprint function to specicy these items.

args is a variable number of things you want to print.

end - The end char to use just like print uses
sep - The separation character like print uses
text_color - The color of the text
key - overrides the previously defined Multiline key
window - overrides the previously defined window to output to
background_color - The color of the background
colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter

There are also "aliases" for text_color, background_color and colors (t, b, c)
t - An alias for color of the text (makes for shorter calls)
b - An alias for the background_color parameter
c - (str, str) - "shorthand" way of specifying color. (foreground, backgrouned)
c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")

With the aliases it's possible to write the same print but in more compact ways:
cprint('This will print white text on red background', c=('white', 'red'))
cprint('This will print white text on red background', c='white on red')
cprint('This will print white text on red background', text_color='white', background_color='red')
cprint('This will print white text on red background', t='white', b='red')

```
cprint(args=*<1 or N object>,
    end = None,
    sep = " ",
    text_color = None,
    font = None,
    t = None,
    background_color = None,
    b = None,
    colors = None,
    c = None,
    window = None,
    key = None,
    justification = None,
    autoscroll = True)

## Popups PEP8 Versions

Popup - Display a popup Window with as many parms as you wish to include.  This is the GUI equivalent of the
"print" statement.  It's also great for "pausing" your program's flow until the user can read some error messages.

If this popup doesn't have the features you want, then you can easily make your own. Popups can be accomplished in 1 line of code:
choice, _ = sg.Window('Continue?', [[sg.T('Do you want to continue?')], [sg.Yes(s=10), sg.No(s=10)]], disable_close=True).read(close=True)

```
popup(args=*<1 or N object>,
    title = None,
    button_color = None,
    background_color = None,
    text_color = None,
    button_type = 0,
    auto_close = False,
    auto_close_duration = None,
    custom_text = (None, None),
    non_blocking = False,

Show animation one frame at a time.  This function has its own internal clocking meaning you can call it at any frequency
 and the rate the frames of video is shown remains constant.  Maybe your frames update every 30 ms but your
 event loop is running every 10 ms.  You don't have to worry about delaying, just call it every time through the
 loop.

Displays a "notification window", usually in the bottom right corner of your display.  Has an icon, a title, and a message.  It is more like a "toaster" window than the normal popups.

The window will slowly fade in and out if desired.  Clicking on the window will cause it to move through the end the current "phase". For example, if the window was fading in and it was clicked, then it would immediately stop fading in and instead be fully visible.  It's a way for the user to quickly dismiss the window.

The return code specifies why the call is returning (e.g. did the user click the message to dismiss it)

```

### `sprint` Popup Alias - Same as popup_scrolled

Show a scrolled Popup window containing the user's text that was supplied.  Use with as many items to print as you
want, just like a print statement.

```

## Popup Not PEP8 Compliant names

*** You should not use these function names! *** 

These versions of the popup functions are here only for backwards compatibility. Instead use the popup functions that have snake_case rather than CamelCase.

Popup - Display a popup Window with as many parms as you wish to include.  This is the GUI equivalent of the
"print" statement.  It's also great for "pausing" your program's flow until the user can read some error messages.

If this popup doesn't have the features you want, then you can easily make your own. Popups can be accomplished in 1 line of code:
choice, _ = sg.Window('Continue?', [[sg.T('Do you want to continue?')], [sg.Yes(s=10), sg.No(s=10)]], disable_close=True).read(close=True)

```
Popup(args=*<1 or N object>,
    title = None,
    button_color = None,
    background_color = None,
    text_color = None,
    button_type = 0,
    auto_close = False,
    auto_close_duration = None,
    custom_text = (None, None),
    non_blocking = False,
    icon = None,
    line_width = None,
    font = None,
    no_titlebar = False,

Show animation one frame at a time.  This function has its own internal clocking meaning you can call it at any frequency
 and the rate the frames of video is shown remains constant.  Maybe your frames update every 30 ms but your
 event loop is running every 10 ms.  You don't have to worry about delaying, just call it every time through the
 loop.

## The Main PySimpleGUI Program - Test Harness, Global Settings, Debug Information, Upgrade from GitHub

A convention that PySimpleGUI uses is that standalone entry points start with "main_".  These calls are essentially a mini-program within the PySimpleGUI.py file.

Used to get SDK help, test the installation, get information about the versions, upgrade from GitHub.

You can call main() from your code and then access these other features such as the global settings. You can also directly call these functions.

You can also type `psgmain` from the command line to access it if you have pip installed your copy of PySimpleGUI.

The PySimpleGUI "Test Harness".  This is meant to be a super-quick test of the Elements.

```
main()
```

Collect up and display the data needed to file GitHub issues.
This function will place the information on the clipboard.
You MUST paste the information from the clipboard prior to existing your application (except on Windows).

```
main_get_debug_data(suppress_popup = False)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| bool | suppress_popup | If True no popup window will be shown. The string will be only returned, not displayed |

Window to set settings that will be used across all PySimpleGUI programs that choose to use them.

## UserSettings API - Class Interface

The User Settings API is used to store your settings information from one session to another or from one program to another.  They are stored on disk in either JSON or INI file formats.

In addition to user settings files, there is also a global PySimpleGUI settings file that PySimpleGUI uses to store information about the default Python interpreter you want to use with the Exec APIs, the default theme. You can directly access the global settings through the UserSettings object: `pysimplegui_user_settings`

User Settings

```
UserSettings(filename = None,
    path = None,

### get

Returns the value of a specified setting.  If the setting is not found in the settings dictionary, then
the user specified default value will be returned.  It no default is specified and nothing is found, then
the "default value" is returned.  This default can be specified in this call, or previously defined
by calling set_default. If nothing specified now or previously, then None is returned as default.

```
save(filename = None, path = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (str or None) | filename | The fFilename to save to. Can specify a path or just the filename. If no filename specified, then the caller's filename will be used. |

## Exec APIs - Launching Subprocesses

These API calls are used to launch subprocesses.  You can launch Python files or any type of executable file.  In these calls is where you invoke the editor and file explorer that was specified in the PySimpleGUI Global Settings.

Runs the specified command as a subprocess.
By default the call is non-blocking.
The function will immediately return without waiting for the process to complete running. You can use the returned Popen object to communicate with the subprocess and get the results.
Returns a subprocess Popen object.

```
execute_command_subprocess(command,
    args=*<1 or N object>,
    wait = False,
    cwd = None,
    pipe_output = False,
    merge_stderr_with_stdout = True,

| bool |       pipe_output        | If True then output from the subprocess will be piped. You MUST empty the pipe by calling execute_get_results or your subprocess will block until no longer full |
| bool | merge_stderr_with_stdout | If True then output from the subprocess stderr will be merged with stdout. The result is ALL output will be on stdout. |
| bool |          stdin           | Value passed to the Popen call. Defaults to subprocess.DEVNULL so that the pyinstaller created executable work correctly |
| (subprocess.Popen) | **RETURN** | Popen object

Runs the editor that was configured in the global settings and opens the file to a specific line number.
Two global settings keys are used.

## Clipboard APIs

Note that this clipboard uses tkinter's clipboard. There is a known limitation that your application needs to remain running until you've pasted the contents.  Managed to get around this limitation so that the clipboard stays set after you exit your application, but only have it working for Windows systems.

Gets the clipboard current value.

```
clipboard_get()
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (str) | **RETURN** | The current value of the clipboard

Sets the clipboard to a specific value.
IMPORTANT NOTE - Your PySimpleGUI application needs to remain running until you've pasted
your clipboard. This is a tkinter limitation.  A workaround was found for Windows, but you still
need to stay running for Linux systems.

```
clipboard_set(new_value)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (str or bytes) | new_value | value to set the clipboard to. Will be converted to a string |

## Misc

Fills a window with values provided in a values dictionary { element_key : new_value }

```
fill_form_with_values(window, values_dict)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|      Window      |   window    | The window object to fill |
| (Dict[Any, Any]) | values_dict | A dictionary with element keys as key and value is values parm for Update call |
| None | **RETURN** | None

Fills a window with values provided in a values dictionary { element_key : new_value }

```

## Old Themes (Look and Feel) - Replaced by theme()

You should NOT use these calls.  They are here for your reference should you run into them in existing code.

Change the "color scheme" of all future PySimpleGUI Windows.
The scheme are string names that specify a group of colors. Background colors, text colors, button colors.
There are 13 different color settings that are changed at one time using a single call to ChangeLookAndFeel
The look and feel table itself has these indexes into the dictionary LOOK_AND_FEEL_TABLE.
The original list was (prior to a major rework and renaming)... these names still work...
In Nov 2019 a new Theme Formula was devised to make choosing a theme easier:
The "Formula" is:
["Dark" or "Light"] Color Number
Colors can be Blue Brown Grey Green Purple Red Teal Yellow Black
The number will vary for each pair. There are more DarkGrey entries than there are LightYellow for example.
Default = The default settings (only button color is different than system default)
Default1 = The full system default including the button (everything's gray... how sad... don't be all gray... please....)

```
ChangeLookAndFeel(index, force = False)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str  | index | the name of the index into the Look and Feel table (does not have to be exact, can be "fuzzy") |
| bool | force | no longer used |
| None | **RETURN** | None

Get a list of the valid values to pass into your call to change_look_and_feel

```
ListOfLookAndFeelValues()
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| List[str] | **RETURN** | list of valid string values

Displays a "Quick Reference Window" showing all of the different Look and Feel settings that are available.
They are sorted alphabetically.  The legacy color names are mixed in, but otherwise they are sorted into Dark and Light halves

```
preview_all_look_and_feel_themes(columns = 12,
    scrollable = False,
    scroll_area_size = (None, None),
    search_string = None,
    location = (None, None))
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|    int     |     columns      | The number of themes to display per row |
|    bool    |    scrollable    | If True then scrollbars will be added |
| (int, int) | scroll_area_size | Size of the scrollable area (The Column Element used to make scrollable) |
|    str     |  search_string   | If specified then only themes containing this string will be shown |
| (int, int) |     location     | Location on the screen to place the window. Defaults to the center like all windows |

Get a list of the valid values to pass into your call to change_look_and_feel
